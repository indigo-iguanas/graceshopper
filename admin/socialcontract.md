Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

	•	●	What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
○	Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
--Come together as much as possible to come to an agreement.
—Put a cap of time to dispute and then come together. 10Min-ish
	•
	•	●	What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
○	What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.
—Appeal another group-member to moderate/mediate. Go up the chain towards a whole group discussion.
—Have an open and unbiased dialogue with the person in the group that is having an issue.

	•	●	What does this group do when we merge our work together?
○	Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?
— Alway do a code review/check in to merge. Review with a partner that is assigned for each work day, but bring in an other group member to approve.
— at least pull in the morning as a fresh start before standup, and meet again to adjust later in day.

	•	●	When does this group ask for help?
○	After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
	•	— around 10minutes, do not linger on frustration.
	•
	•	●	How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?




	•	○	Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?
	— Natural breaking point or an hour max before a switch.


	•	●	How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
○	Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
— try to work on Sat.’s but be open and communicate on what is to be done.
	Talk about and agree with who is doing what after hours. Guard against mistakes in solo work.

	•	●	What time does this group have daily stand up?
— After REACTO set up out stand ups. Look to the schedule.
